## Installation

Use git's tag v1.0.0 for the old, the tag v2.0.0 for the new Facebook design. 
The tag v3.0.0 and up is for a new execution method including a `config` command.
Up of v4.0.0, you will also have additional config possibilities and [pptr](https://pptr.dev/) was 
changed for [playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright).

Note that you need to set the language of Facebook to English 
for this to work out of the box.
