## Installation

Use git's tag v1.0.0 for the old, the tag v2.0.0 for the new Facebook design. 
The tag v3.0.0 and up is for a new execution method including a `config` command.
Up of v4.0.0, you will also have additional config possibilities and [pptr](https://pptr.dev/) was 
changed for [playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright).

Note that you need to set the language of Facebook to English 
for this to work out of the box.

### Via Repo (recommended as tested)
Download this repository, unpack it. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. 
Then, from the root of this repo/directory, run `yarn install` (make sure to have yarn installed) to run.

### Via NPM/yarn (untested)
Install this repo like:
`npm install --global fb-birthday-gratulator`

(replace `npm install` with `yarn add` if you do not belong to the mainstream)

## Configuration
A file named `config.json` in the root of the directory, in which this tool has been installed to, can be used for the configuration. The content of the `config.json` have the structure (replace strings as appropriate):

```json
{
  "username": "your@email.com",
  "password": "your/pass/word!",
  "wishes":  {
    "anyone": [
      "Happy birthday! ;D",
      "Happy birthday! ü•≥üéàüéÅüéäü•≥",
      "Best wishes & many presents! üéÅüéäüéÅ"
    ],
    "Your Loved Ones FB-Name": [
      "Enjoy your day, my Love! üòòüíï‚ù§Ô∏è"
    ]
  }
}
```

Note that at the moment, the config is not getting validated in any useful form ‚Äì you will just get the failure notification.
